# ANN21_Image_Classification_Model

This is the model I developed for a university project in the course of Artificial Neural Networks & Deep Learning. 
We were provided with a dataset composed of 17728 RGB images of leaves (size 256x256). 
The images were grouped into 14 classes, corresponding to different types of plant species. 
Being a classification problem, given a new image of a leaf, the goal was to predict the correct class label.

The model was finally tested with an automatic tool on a test set achieving an accuracy of 92.83% correct predictions.
